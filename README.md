# HackerRank-Tester
This is a program meant to organize and test solutions for challenges on hackerrank. Currently, functionality is limited due to the lack of a GUI.

In the future, the program will organize each solution in its own directory, and will run it against all tests in the test directory. Tests must be named as follows:

input: "input\*.txt"
output: "output\*.txt"
